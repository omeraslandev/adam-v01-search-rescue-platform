# adam-v01-search-rescue-platform
An autonomous robotic solution for post-disaster environments where networks fail. By fusing Thermal, ToF, and Acoustic sensors on a high-efficiency STM32 platform, this unit acts as the "forward eye" for rescue teams, retrieving life-saving data during the critical "golden hours" without putting human responders at risk.
